# CalHist_PHARM_GPU
this is an optimum cuda implementaion of Pharm method. you can find matlab project here: http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/feature_extractors/

Pharm: HARM feature project in ZIP (for Windows) and TAR (for Linux) contains C++ source code and Matlab MEX makefile. Extraction using the MEX file much faster.

Important: Implementations for different systems (Matlab, Windows, Linux) will output different feature values due to their random generators. However, they should have identical performance.
